      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>
Delaram Barati is a multidisciplinary artist and entrepreneur with a background in Environmental Science (B.Sc.) and Urban Design (M.Sc.). Throughout her academic and professional journey, she has sought to create meaningful connections between art, culture, and the environment.
      </p>
      <p>
     After the birth of her son and living in six different provinces of Iran, her passion for personal creativity and entrepreneurship deepened, leading her to establish the jewelry brand Delban. For her, enamel work and jewelry design are not merely about crafting beautiful objects—they are a way to convey Iranian artistic heritage to the world.      </p>
      <p>
Her artistic and research interests lie at the intersection of painting, calligraphy, and traditional Iranian arts. She is particularly fascinated by how art and design can honor cultural identity while offering contemporary and inspiring experiences to audiences.     </p>
      <p>
Her goal in pursuing doctoral studies is to deepen her artistic and scholarly knowledge, develop strategies for expanding the reach of Iranian art globally, and contribute to preserving cultural heritage while creating innovative, authentic works.      </p>
