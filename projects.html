This project was a collaborative effort for a competition aimed at redesigning the Khajeh Khezr neighborhood. Our team consisted of a team leader and 15 members, with each person responsible for designing a specific part of the neighborhood. This team structure allowed us to work in a precise and coordinated manner.
Design Approach
  Modular Design: For the residential buildings, we adopted a modular design approach. This means the buildings were composed of similar structural units, or 'cells'. This method of design makes construction simpler and faster while giving the entire neighborhood a cohesive and harmonious appearance.
  Focus on Resident Needs: At the beginning of the project, we carefully examined the needs and lifestyles of both current and future residents. This helped us design spaces that are truly functional and useful. For example, amenities, public spaces, and access routes were designed to meet people's daily needs.
  Prioritizing Green Space and Social Interaction: One of our most important goals was to create a space that would strengthen social connections and improve the quality of life. For this reason, we placed a special emphasis on designing public green spaces. Parks, gardens, and wide sidewalks with greenery were included to allow residents to interact easily with one another and spend their free time in a pleasant environment. These spaces were designed to serve as the beating heart of the neighborhood.
Overall, this project was not just an architectural exercise; it was an effort to create a better and more sustainable living environment for the people of the Khajeh Khezr neighborhood.">

This project is the design of a commercial and administrative complex located in the city of Kerman, Iran. The design is a modern interpretation of the city's rich architectural heritage, drawing inspiration from the native, historical style of the Qajar era. This choice was made to honor and integrate with the local urban fabric.
The complex is currently under construction, which means the design phase is complete and the physical building is being erected. A key aspect of the design is the careful selection of construction materials. These materials were chosen specifically to be suitable for Kerman's hot and arid climate. This ensures the building will be energy-efficient and comfortable for its occupants while also being durable and sustainable.
In essence, the project blends traditional Qajar-era aesthetics with modern functionality and climate-responsive architecture, creating a building that is both culturally relevant and practical.">

          data-desc="Landscape Design with a Focus on Climate and Topography
            This project involves the landscape design for the front area of an office building, where two key factors—topography (the shape and slope of the land) and the local climate—were given serious consideration.
            Managing the Site's Topography
            The area from the entrance to the building has a natural slope with an elevation change of about 3 meters. Instead of simply covering this slope, the designers divided it into three distinct levels. This approach offers several benefits:
            Visual Appeal: The tiered levels give the landscape a dynamic and visually appealing look, breaking up a monotonous flat surface.
            Easier Access: By creating steps and ramps on each level, movement for people is made easier, and the change in elevation is managed gradually.
            Versatile Use: Each of these levels can be designed for different functions, such as seating areas, garden beds, or walking paths.
            Sustainable Rainwater Management
            Since the project site is located in an area with high rainfall, the natural slope of the land was used as an opportunity. By designing specific channels and pathways, rainwater is directed toward a collection reservoir instead of being wasted. This system provides important ecological and economic advantages:
            Sustainable Water Use: The collected water is stored in the reservoir and can be used for irrigating the green spaces during dry seasons.
            Reduced Municipal Water Consumption: This method significantly reduces the need for city water for irrigation, saving both costs and resources.
            Flood Prevention: The controlled redirection of water to the reservoir prevents it from pooling on the surface and causing small floods on the property.
            Overall, this design demonstrates a smart approach where the site's natural features—its slope and rainfall—were transformed from potential challenges into opportunities for creating a beautiful, functional, and sustainable space.">
