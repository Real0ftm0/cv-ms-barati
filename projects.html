          data-desc="Landscape Design with a Focus on Climate and Topography
            This project involves the landscape design for the front area of an office building, where two key factors—topography (the shape and slope of the land) and the local climate—were given serious consideration.
            Managing the Site's Topography
            The area from the entrance to the building has a natural slope with an elevation change of about 3 meters. Instead of simply covering this slope, the designers divided it into three distinct levels. This approach offers several benefits:
            Visual Appeal: The tiered levels give the landscape a dynamic and visually appealing look, breaking up a monotonous flat surface.
            Easier Access: By creating steps and ramps on each level, movement for people is made easier, and the change in elevation is managed gradually.
            Versatile Use: Each of these levels can be designed for different functions, such as seating areas, garden beds, or walking paths.
            Sustainable Rainwater Management
            Since the project site is located in an area with high rainfall, the natural slope of the land was used as an opportunity. By designing specific channels and pathways, rainwater is directed toward a collection reservoir instead of being wasted. This system provides important ecological and economic advantages:
            Sustainable Water Use: The collected water is stored in the reservoir and can be used for irrigating the green spaces during dry seasons.
            Reduced Municipal Water Consumption: This method significantly reduces the need for city water for irrigation, saving both costs and resources.
            Flood Prevention: The controlled redirection of water to the reservoir prevents it from pooling on the surface and causing small floods on the property.
            Overall, this design demonstrates a smart approach where the site's natural features—its slope and rainfall—were transformed from potential challenges into opportunities for creating a beautiful, functional, and sustainable space.">
